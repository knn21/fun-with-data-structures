*Solution:*

(a) advantages of using fixed capacity array over linked list to store ordered items
- constant time O(1) access to smallest (first index) and largest (last index) items 
- logarithmic time O(lg n) binary search access as data is sorted 

(b) advantages of using linked list over fixed capacity array to store ordered items
- constant time O(1) access to insert smallest item to head of linked list
- efficient use of memory to insert item into correct position by adjusting pointers

(c)(i) recursive

(ii) base/terminating case

(iii) computes size of linked list / number of items in linked list recursively

(d)

```
FUNCTION Z(Head)
    IF Head is NIL OR Head.next is NIL
        RETURN Head
    ENDIF
    newHead = Z(Head.next)
    Head.next.next = Head
    Head.next = null    
    RETURN newHead
ENDFUNCTION
```
(e) why mergesort may be faster than quicksort in this situation
- mergesort is a divide and conquer algorithm and for any data set (ordered or unordered) is guaranteed to perform in O(n lg n) linearithmic efficiency as the split phase will evenly divide the array by half achieving O(lg n) performance
- quicksort will not perform well for an ordered data set if the pivot is chosen to be the first (smallest) or last (largest) item, as this will unevenly divide the left and right subarrays (effectively reducing the problem size only by one item instead of half the number of items) leading to worst case O(n^2) quadratic time complexity.

b) Inserted Eric (7) 

Logic: 
E < L go left
E > B go right
E > D go right
D.right = NULL
Insert to right of D

c) Pseudocode: recursive inorder on names 
note: procedure doesnâ€™t return, procedure outputs

```
PROCEDURE inorder(Root)
    IF Root is not NULL
        inorder( Names[ Root ].LPtr )
        OUTPUT( Names[ Root ].data )
        inorder( Names[ Root ].RPtr )
    ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
